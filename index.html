University of St. Thomas presents...
Water Week: Flowing Through St. Thomas
Mni Wiconi - Water is Life

What is Water Week?
From December 6 to December 10, the University of St. Thomas will celebrate water and explore what water is to us. Water has many different meanings to many people, but one universal idea stands out from the rest: "Water is Life." Water is constantly around us, and we use it in our everyday lives. From the food we eat to the clothes we wear, water is essential.
