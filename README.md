# Water Week: Flowing Through St. Thomas README

> *Mni Wiconi - Water is Life*

### What is Water Week?
From December 6 to December 10, the University of St. Thomas will celebrate water and explore what water is to us. Water has many different meanings to many people, but one universal idea stands out from the rest: "Water is Life." Water is constantly around us, and we use it in our everyday lives. From the food we eat to the clothes we wear, water is essential. 

## The History of Water On Campus

[History of Water] (docs/history.md)

### Lake Mennith
Over 100 years ago near the founding of the University of St. Thomas, much of what we now know as the lower quad was covered in a lake -- Lake Mennith. Lake Mennith, (Mennith now the name of the building between Dowling Hall and SJV on the upper quad), covered much of the land of what is now occupied by O’Shaughnessy-Frey Library, O’Shaughnessy Educational Center, and Murray-Herrick Campus Center. However, after the construction of a sewer line under Summit Avenue, much of the lake was drained and eventually disappeared into the beautiful yet dry landscape that we have today. Although we can no longer see Lake Mennith or experience the joys of lake life that we all know to love in Minnesota, there is still a spot of campus where you can see what remains of Lake Mennith: the basement of the library. Deep in the base of O’Shaughnessy-Frey Library, in a plumbing closet and under a grate, you can not only see the water of Lake Mennith, but you can also hear the calming stream that used to encompass much of what we know now to be campus. Knowing our campus and its water history is an important part of moving forward to making water more visible throughout our community and our world.

## Catholic Social Teaching and Water Justice:

Catholic Social Teaching is an important part of the University of St. Thomas’s values and mission. One of the main principles of Catholic Social Teaching is Life and Dignity of the Human Person, which directly protects the preservation of water and water justice. The core of this principle of Catholic Social Teaching calls for everyone to care for each other and make sure that each person is able to live in a way that honors their human dignity; this ultimately includes having access to basic needs, especially water. The lack of access to clean water both locally and globally inevitably creates living conditions that do not honor the dignity of the human person. In order to be aligned with the University of St. Thomas’s values and those of Catholic Social Teaching, it is both important and necessary that we, as a community, work to protect and preserve water and the communities that are most affected by its scarcity.
