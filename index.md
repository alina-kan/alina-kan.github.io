### What is Water Week?
From December 8 to December 15, the University of St. Thomas will celebrate water and explore what water is to us. Water has many different meanings to many people, but one universal idea stands out from the rest: "Water is Life." Water is constantly around us, and we use it in our everyday lives. From the food we eat to the clothes we wear, water is essential.

## Water Justice in Minnesota
### Line 3
As part of the Minnesotan community, we should all know by now the pride that Minnesota takes in the lakes that call our state home. Because of this, it’s important to recognize the very real threats that our precious freshwater sources face here at home in Minnesota. One of the biggest threats is the construction of oil pipelines, particularly the construction of the Line 3 oil pipeline that stretches from Alberta, Canada, to Superior, Wisconsin, running through the treaty territories and wetlands of the Anishinaabe peoples. Pipelines break -- there’s no way of evading that inevitable future. In order to protect and respect our treaties, our freshwater resources, and the future of the wellbeing of our state, it’s utterly important that we reject the construction and usage of pipelines now and in the future. Please, to read more information and see what you can do to combat this issue, visit the Stop Line 3 website to learn more from our local organizers: https://www.stopline3.org/#intro.

## Catholic Social Teaching and Water Justice:

Catholic Social Teaching is an important part of the University of St. Thomas’s values and mission. One of the main principles of Catholic Social Teaching is Life and Dignity of the Human Person, which directly protects the preservation of water and water justice. The core of this principle of Catholic Social Teaching calls for everyone to care for each other and make sure that each person is able to live in a way that honors their human dignity; this ultimately includes having access to basic needs, especially water. The lack of access to clean water both locally and globally inevitably creates living conditions that do not honor the dignity of the human person. In order to be aligned with the University of St. Thomas’s values and those of Catholic Social Teaching, it is both important and necessary that we, as a community, work to protect and preserve water and the communities that are most affected by its scarcity.
